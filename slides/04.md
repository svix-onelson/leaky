## Cool Tips

- Build the binary, then run it. Don't `cargo run`.
- When comparing different impls, rename the binary to reflect the version.
- There is an API reference for the DSL in "the book."
- Profiler data is **LARGE** for long runtimes.
  - Set `MEMORY_PROFILER_CULL_TEMPORARY_ALLOCATIONS=1` for this use case.
